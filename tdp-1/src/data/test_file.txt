The third edition of this popular and engaging text consolidates the interdisciplinary streams of
cognitive science to present a uniﬁed narrative of cognitive science as a discipline in its own right.
It teaches students to apply the techniques and theories of the cognitive scientist’s “tool kit” – the
vast range of methods and tools that cognitive scientists use to study the mind. Thematically
organized, Cognitive Science underscores the problems and solutions of cognitive science rather
than more narrowly examining individually the subjects that contribute to it – psychology,
neuroscience, linguistics, and so on. The generous use of examples, illustrations, and applications
demonstrates how theory is applied to unlock the mysteries of the human mind. Drawing upon
cutting-edge research, the text has been substantially revised, with new material on Bayesian
approaches to the mind and on deep learning. An extensive online set of resources is available to
aid instructors and students alike. Sample syllabi show how the text can support a variety of
courses, making it a highly ﬂexible teaching and learning resource at both the undergraduate and
graduate levels.
